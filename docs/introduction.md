# A (very) brief introduction


## Setting up your development environment

### Step 0. Installing Go

Like anything, their is a couple ways to go about this step. You can A). install Go is to head over to [go.dev/dl](https://go.dev/dl) and download the binary realease for your system. There, you will find additional installation instructions depending on your setup.

B). Alternatively, if you're on macOS or Linux you can use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) to install Go.
- First install brew if you haven't already by going to [brew.sh](https://brew.sh) and paste the installation script in your terminal
- In your terminal , run `brew install go` to install

Once you have Go installed, you can run `go version` in your terminal or powershell to print out the version of Go you have just installed and make sure that everything is installed correctly.

### Step 1. The Editor

Now that you have Go installed, the next step is to start writing some code. The editor/IDE of choice comes down to personal preference so use whatever makes you happy. I like to use [Goland](https://jetbrains.com/go) or [VSCode](https://code.visualstudeo.com) for my projects. You can get a free license for Goland if you use your student email. If you're not a student, you can get a free trial to see if you like it before committing to it. VSCode on the other hand is free for everyone!

!!! tip
	You can get a free access to JetBrains IDEs (including Goland) and other tools if you are a student of faculty. You can get more information [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/edu-products/download/#section=goland-go). If you're not a student on faculty, you can get a free 30 day trial to test it out first.

For both Goland and VSCode I like to install the vim extensions because my fingers are used to the keybindings at this point. For VSCode I do recommend installing the [Go extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=golang.Go)for language specific support.

Now that you have language and the editor, let's go write some code...
